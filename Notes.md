## Review Hello World 

* Congrats! You finished your first lesson in C#. In this lesson you learned:

* C# is used to make interactive websites, mobile apps, video games, augmented and virtual      reality (AR and VR), back-end services, and desktop applications

* .NET generally refers to the family of programs and commands that let you make applications with C#

*  C# and .NET jobs are out there! Build video games with Unity, build websites with ASP.NET…The skills you learn on Codecademy can open new doors

* The command Console.WriteLine() prints text to the console

* The command Console.ReadLine() captures user input in the console

* Comments are lines of code that are ignored by your computer; they’re intended to be read by  developers instead. Make them with // or /_ and _/

## Data Types and Variables 

- [x] Common C# data types
- [x] How to create variables that are statically typed
- [x] How to convert variables from one data to another 

The functin do the following: 
- capitalize: will turn lowercase characters into uppercase characters
- square: will square a number
- evaluate: will determine if an input is true or false

 The data types include:

- int (4637): whole integer number
- string (kangaroo): a piece of text
- bool (true): represents the logical idea of true or false

## Converting Data Types 

 Because of that, there are a couple different ways to do data type conversion:

* implicit conversion: happens automatically if no data will be lost in the conversion. That’s why it’s possible to convert an int (which can hold less data) to a double (which can hold more), but not the other way around.

* explicit conversion: requires a cast operator to convert a data type into another one. So if we do want to convert a double to an int, we could use the operator (int).

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators Operators includes the following: 

* addition + 
* subtraction -
* multiplication * 
* division /
